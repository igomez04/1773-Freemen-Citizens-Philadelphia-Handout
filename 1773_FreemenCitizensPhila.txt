TO THE FREEMEN, CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.
THE Preservation of the Rights and Privileges of the King's Subjects, being an Object of the greatest Importance to their En-
joyment of Liberty and Property, should incite every Freeman to give his Fellow-Citizens occasional Hits, respecting their
dangerous Situation.--Altho' I am a plain unlettered old Man, not desirous of engaging in Points of Political Disputation, never-,
theless, breathing the Spirit of genuine Freedom, I cannot keep Silence, when I observe the Power which ought to be the Guardi-
an of the Rights of the Subject, applied to the purposesnot of preserving, but of overturning the Principles of our Constitution, and more
particularly the Liberties of one of the Capital Cities in America.
    The Historic Page, and our own Observations produce ample Testimonies, that Rights and Privileges once loft, seldom are regain-
ed, without risking the overthrow of the Community.-- This Risk, however, should not deter the injured from seeking Redress in
every justifiable and constitutional Manner; and tho' Success may not always crown the Event, good Men in our own Times, as
well as Posterity will give Honor to the Men, whose Intrepidity braved Oppression, and be Proofs sufficient to convince even the Op-
pressors, that to govern a free People, by any other Standard than Justice, and the Laws of the Land, is the meanest Character in the
Circle of Human Deformities.
    That Causes founded in Oppression have, and now do exist among us, from which, effects dangerous to the Liberties of the Ci-
tizens are produced, cannot be denied; and that my Fellow-Citizens may be reminded of the successive means used by the Corpo-
ration to divest them of part of their Rights and Privileges, I shall lay before them the Authorities on which the Corporation
presumed to exercise such Power, and the Opposition given by the Citizens to their unwarrantable Proceedings.
    In the City Charter it appears, there are three Modes pointed out for obtaining a Corporation Freedom, either of which being compli-
ed with gives a Person an indisputable Right and Privileges of that Freedom; but the Corporation, regardless of every Mode prescrib-
ed, that did not operate for their private Interest, obliged Numbers of respectable Men (possessed of Estates and Effects to entitle them
to a Vote in the Choice of the Representatives in Assembly) to purchase at such Sums of Money as the Corporation should direct,
the Liberty of trading; otherwise, they were forbid to open Store, sell Goods, or set up their Trades within the Limits of the City.
This Practice continued for some Years, when during the Recordership of R. Ashton, several Persons of whom Money was demanded,
examining into their Rights as "Liege Subjects of the King," found by the Royal Charter granted to "William Penn, and other
Authorities, they were free "Traders, without the Licence of the Corporation, of every Port in Pennsylvania," and rather than
submit to the Imposition of having Money taken from them without their Consent, suffered ill-treatment, and even were dragged to
the Goal by Virtue of the Corporation's Influence.
I. In the Act of General Assembly, passed Anno 1722, "for establishing a Ferry over the River Schuylkill at the End of the High-
    "Street of Philadelphia," it is declared, that, "for the greater Conveniency of the Inhabitants on the West side of the River
    " Schuylkill, travelling to and from the City, the Mayor and Commonalty shall cause to be made a sufficient Causway and Landing
    " at the End of the said High-Street, on both sides of the said River, and shall provide and maintain Ferry Boats and Ferry Men,
    " who shall reside and dwell on the WEST Side of Schuylkill River," -and the Corporation are authorized to receive certain stipu-
    lated "Rates for Ferriage, and no more." The Corporation not content with having a Ferry and Ferriages established agreeable to
the Law made in that Cafe and Provided, but about the Year 1742, erected a large Brick Building on the EAST Side of the said Ri-
ver, wherein the Ferry-Men reside and dwell, and in some Instances receive Ferriages a fourth of the Sum more than specified by Law;
to let out the said Ferry at a proportionable Rent, in Order to encrease their private Revenue;-the said Brick Building being erect-
ed in 1he middle of High-Street, contrary to the Spirit of the City Charter, and of the Concessions, which declare the "Streets and
" Roads to be public Highways."
II. ln the City Charter aforesaid, are the following Words, " I William Penn do also Ordain that the Landing Places now and
    " heretofore used at the Penny Pot House and Blue Anchor, having to all Persons their just and legal Rights and Properties, in
    " the Land so to be open, shall be left open and common for the use of the said City, and all others."
    Notwithstanding the Grant of the forementioned Premises to the Citizens, the Mayor and Commonalty in the Year 17 53, by an
Advertisement published in the Pennsylvania Gazette, No. 1259, offered " to Let" the said landing Places, " for a Term of Years,
" or, on a Ground-Rent forever," to apply the Issues and Profits arising therefrom, to the Corporation's private Fund.-In Cons-
quence of the Advertisement, the City Wardens, Assessors, Overseers of the Poor, County Commissioners (as incorporated public
Bodies) and a Number of other Reputable Citizens, in behalf of themselves and the Freemen of the City, justly alarmed at this ma-
nifest Instance of Arbitrary Power, to deprive the Citizens of their " Rights and Privileges," met together on the Occasion, drew
up and presented a spirited Memorial, and nobly stood forth in Support of it, and their Liberties.--The Corporation finding the
Inhabitants not sufficiently lull'd for admitting of the Execution of their Design, withdrew their Pretensions.
    As Justice is due to Men in every Period of Time, who were desirous of supporting the Rights of the Subject, and from whom a
Comparison with modern Men may be made, I shall relate in what Manner the Mayor and Commonalty acted in the Year
1691, when the Commissioners of Property were endeavouring, unknown to the Proprietary, to let the said public Landing Places
for his private Benefit; the said Mayor and Commonalty, altho' cloathed with the same Power as the Corporation of 1753, or any
subsequent Date, instead of depriving the Citizens of their Liberties, appeared in their Defence, and prevented the same being taken
from them.--Governor Lloyd and the Council, by a Minute of Council, Aug. 3, 1691, confirmed the Citizens Rights to the said
Premises, and will remain a lasting Monument of their Honor and public Virtue. 
III. The 2d Clause of the City Charter declares, that " the Ends of each Street extending into the River Delaware shall be, and
    " continue free for the Use and Service of the said City, and the Inhabitants thereof, who, may improve the same for the best Ad-
    " vantage of the City, and build Wharffs so far out into the River there, as the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council here-
    " in aftermentioned, shall seem meet." -- Which Clause shows the Privilege and Property of the Ends of the Streets to be invest-
ed in the Inhabitants, and that the Mayor and Commonalty have no other Authority than to direct how far the said Wharfs shall ex-
tend. --The Corporation nevertheless, have taken Possession of the Ends of the Streets, built Wharfs, and impose, under the Name
of Wood-Cordage, a Tax on the Inhabitants without their Consent, and unless prevented, may increase that Impost to any Sum
they please.
    There are several other Matters of public Concern, which the Corporation have arrogated to themselves the Direction of, such
as Measurers of Salt, Wheat, and the Building of Stalls in the public Streets or " Highways," for either of which Ac1ions, they
have no legal Power.
    There my Fellow-Citizens are Facts, the greatest Advocate for Corporation Dominion will not be hardy enough to deny, and
are sufficient to show the several Efforts made to increase their private Fund* at your Expence, which Fund according to the establish-
ed Rules of progressive Number, will amount in a few Years to many score Thousand Pounds, and will become dangerous to the
safety of yourselves and Posterity, and that Wealth and Opportunity are only wanting to fanctify Measures, which may not be obtain-
ed by them on the Principles of Justice or Equity.
    The Corporation to answer their Purposes will endeavour to colour their Proceedings, and explain away the meaning of the City
Charter, but while Actions speak louder than Words, no Construction however strained, can be available in Law or Justice, to alienate
the Rights and Privileges from the Citizens; and therefore nothing short of a legal Opposition to Acts detrimental in their Conse-
quences to Liberty and Property will be likely to succeed; but should the Avenues to Justice be shut up, as the executive Parts of
Government here are invested in the Hands of Persons, who are Members of the Corporation; the last Remedy will then be, for the
Citizens to apply in an united Representation, and Petition to the King, pointing out their particular Grievances, and praying he
will exercise his Royal Prerogative to dissolve the Charter of the City, by Reason of the Corporation's mis-user of the Powers granted
to them.
