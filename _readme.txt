	My assigned collection consists of a one-sided sheet photographed on both sides with the back side being completely empty. The information for most of the metadata is the same as only one side contains relevant information. For the CSV file, I decided to include basic information that would be telling of where the item originated from, who the publisher was (if any), the date it was published, as well as the title and other relevant information about the piece of paper itself (language, and type). I chose these categories because they good a good background on the broader context of the piece to help the reader situate themselves. I also included a ÒnotesÓ column, which distinguishes the relevant information from the front side file compared to the back side file. The notes for the front side give relevant information of what the text is about and what it is trying to achieve. In this case it states, ÒAgainst the manner in which the Corporation of Philadelphia operated the Schuylkill ferry,Ó as well as who signed it and the date. The notes for the back side simply state it is a blank page and gives details about the creases and folds of the paper. This metadata allows for further research either by geography, date, collection, etc. 

  When extracting and cleaning the text, the OCR was mostly clear in around 75% of the text. However, one problem I encountered was the long S that is used in the text. This letter is used throughout all the text but was mostly recognized as "f" or "l" so I had to go back and change all of the words that included the long S. This took me a longer time becuase I had to check word by word. The other letter that was also confused in some instances was the capital letter W, this was mistaken as different charracters such as "\\" and "v". The other problem I encountered was when words were split between lines and were joined by a dash between lines. Words being split is very common in this text so I also had to go through each line making sure they were split correctly. Lastly, there was a type of table at the bottom of the text outlining information about prices and annual income. Surpsingly, the table was pretty similar after OCR, there was just missalignment of the prices and the dashes that connect the text with the prices, but most of the text was clear and written correctly.
